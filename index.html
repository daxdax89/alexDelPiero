        <p>He was a Freekick machine! Players and goalkeepers around the world were afraid of him. They knew that if they make foul over him under 30 meters distance, he wil 95% score. Freekick is same as penalty for Alex. I feel so bad for never having
          an opportunity and honor to be his coach<br>
